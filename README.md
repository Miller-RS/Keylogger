# Keylogger
This repository contains a basic Python keylogger for Windows, built for educational purposes to demonstrate low-level system interaction using ctypes. It captures keystrokes and logs them to keys_log.txt, handling basic text input and Caps Lock. Use responsibly and ethically. This code should only be used for legal and authorized purposes.
